Hey everyone,

I'm Elizabeth Sajewski, PhD. 

I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health in the Department of Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases and the Public Health Modeling Unit.

I use mathematical and statistical models to predict, explore, and compare the impacts of vaccination and other interventions on enteric and respiratory diseases, including norovirus, COVID-19, and, currently, rotavirus and typhoid fever.
